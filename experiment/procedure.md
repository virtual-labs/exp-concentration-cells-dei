**Procedure :**	
 
1.	Prepare solution A (0.20 M) by weighing 5 g of CuSO₄·5H₂O and transferring it to a 100 mL volumetric flask, then making up the volume with deionized water.<br>
2.	Prepare solution B (0.10 M) by weighing 2.5 g of CuSO₄·5H₂O and transferring it to a 100 mL volumetric flask, then making up the volume with deionized water.<br>
3.	Connect the two beakers using a KCl salt bridge.<br>
4.	Immerse clean copper electrodes of identical size into each solution.<br>
5.	Connect the copper electrodes to a voltmeter using crocodile clips.<br>
6.	The electrode in 0.20 M CuSO₄ solution was connected to the positive terminal, while the electrode in 0.10 M CuSO₄ solution was connected to the negative terminal of the voltmeter.<br>
7.	Record the cell voltage and observe its decrease with time until equilibrium is reached.<br>
8.	Add Na₂S solution to the higher concentration solution to reduce Cu²⁺ concentration and observe the reversal of the cell voltage.<br>
