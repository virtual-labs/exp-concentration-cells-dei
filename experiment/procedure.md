Procedure for the experiment is as follows:
				
					Take two beakers A & B.
					Add the two different concentration electrolytic solution in both the beaker.
					Dip the like electrodes in both the beaker.
					 Connect both electrodes through crocodile clip, further connected to voltameter.
					Insert the salt bridge to connect both the beakers.
					Through the process voltage declines till the equilibrium attained.
					The reaction is reversed when the Na2S added to the solution at higher concentration.
