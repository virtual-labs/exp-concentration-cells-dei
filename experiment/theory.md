### Theory:
The cell which involves the transfer of matter from one half cell to other due to the difference in concentration of electrolytic solutions, results into the production of electro motive force(EMF) of the cell are known as concentration cell. 
They are classified into following types:

(A)	Electrode concentration cell.

(B)	Electrolyte concentration cell.

SrNo | Electrode (Concentration) | Electrolytic Solution (Concentration) | Electrolytic Solution (Concentration)
:--|:--|:--|:--|
1 |Electrode concentration cell . |Varies in terms of pressure . | Remains Same. 
2 | Electrode concentration cell. | Remains same. | Varies in terms of molarity etc.

Electrode: like electrodes (Cu).
Electrolytic solution: Copper sulfate solution (CuSO<sub>4</sub>).
Cell representation: Cu | Cu<sup>+2</sup><sub>(a1)</sub> || Cu<sup>+2</sup><sup>(a2)</sup> | Cu.

**Working:**

The cell contains a redox reaction in between beaker A & beaker B connected through a salt bridge.
Reactions involved in the process:
At Anode: Cu → Cu<sup>+2</sup><sub>(a1)</sub> + 2 e<sup>-</sup>       Oxidation
At Cathode: Cu<sup>+2</sup><sub>(a2)</sub> + 2 e<sup>-</sup> → Cu     Reduction
Overall reaction: Cu<sup>+2</sup><sub> (a2)</sub> → Cu<sup>+2</sup><sub>(a1)</sub>
