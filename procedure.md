**Procedure for the experiment is as follows:**
	
1. Take two beakers A & B.

2. Add the two different concentration electrolytic solution in both the beaker.

3. Dip the like electrodes in both the beaker.

4. Connect both electrodes through crocodile clip, further connected to voltameter.

5. Insert the salt bridge to connect both the beakers.

6. Through the process voltage declines till the equilibrium attained.

7. The reaction is reversed when the Na<sub>2</sub>S added to the solution at higher concentration.


(i) The electrolytic solution must have different concentrations.<br>

(ii) Nature of electrode depends on electrolytic solution.<br>

(iii) Salt bridge is used to prevent diffusion of solution from one half cell to other.<br>

(iv) Ecell value for spontaneous process is equal to positive.<br>

(v) If the concentration of electrolytic solution is same, Ecell = 0.<br>

(vi) Cathode and Anode depends on the concentration of electrolytic solution.<br>
